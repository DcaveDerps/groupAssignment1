# groupAssignment1
Repo for the first group assignment

This program takes a name as the user's input, as well as a date in mm/dd/yyyy format. 
The program will print a greeting with the user's name, and then will use formulas inside the program to determine the day of the week of the date inputted by the user. 

For example, if I input 10/09/2019, the daycalc method should print that the day is a Wednesday. 

Group members: Derek Halbedl, Lindsey Rojtas
