# groupAssignment1

This program, after taking some user inputs, greets the client with their name and a day of the week. 

# Getting Started
Any application that runs Python can be used to write this program!

## If using Jupyter Notebook (RECOMMENDED) ... 
Create a code cell and paste the code into the cell, then click run!
(Or, just download the .ipynb file we provided and click run, if you don't feel like making your own notebook)

## If using an IDE, like PyCharm... 
Create a new Python file in a new or existing project folder, paste the code from the .ipynb file, and click the run button, wherever that may be in your IDE!

## If using the command line...
Paste the code from the .ipynb file into a text editor application, and save the file you created as a .py file. Then, in your command prompt, input the following (YOURFILE should be replace with, well, whatever you named your file). 
```python 
python3 YOURFILE.py
```
# Development
## Team
Our team consists of two freshman college students who really only wrote this program to get credit for a required first-year class. We are not very experienced, but our names and roles are listed here. 
* [Derek Halbedl](https://github.com/DcaveDerps) (co-creator, pull request master, Python array writer)
* [Lindsey Rojtas](https://github.com/rojtas) (co-creator, Python math operations writer)

## Contributing
Want to contribute to our very tiny program? Just make sure you are working in JupyterLab, and submit your pull request when you're ready!
